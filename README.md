# PACKT BOOK - Django 2 By Example

This respository is the result of the first app created in the book, a blog with more functionality than the one we created before and hopefully solidifies some concepts regarding models, views and urls.

### Notes if you download or clone this respository

I have added the sqlite3 database in gitignore, please remember to do the migrate steps for the models of Post and Comment, so that it will create the database for you.

### Creativen and Friends
Thank you for visiting our repo.
